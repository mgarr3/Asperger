#What's this about?

The idea came to me when sharing my experiences with other parents. Somehow, and forgive me for saying this (truly sincere apologies, really!),
I didn't understand why they were having so much trouble processing their grief. I didn't know at that time, that getting your child's
diagnostic could lead a parent to feel grief, and in many cases, it would be a lot!
